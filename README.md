## 📘 Project Overview — A Short Story

Flight delays are disruptive, expensive, and unpredictable. Tunisair provides thousands of flight entries each year — but what patterns explain these delays, and can we predict them?
This project combines exploratory analysis, feature engineering, machine learning, and interactive reporting to understand why Tunisair flights are delayed and to build a model that predicts those delays before they occur.

You’ll find:
- Cleaned and enriched flight records
- Route-level temporal features
- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- Exported prediction dataset for BI tools
- An interactive Streamlit delay predictor
- A Tableau dashboard showing operational insights

## The analytical journey (story + code)

### 1) Loading the data — first glance
We begin by loading the raw flight logs and parsing the timestamp columns to set expectations:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data/Tunisair_flights_dataset.csv', parse_dates=['scheduled_dep', 'actual_dep', 'scheduled_arr', 'actual_arr'])
df.head()
```

**Narrative:** At this stage I check for missing timestamps, impossible times, and columns needed for modeling.

---

### 2) Cleaning & sanity checks
Clip unrealistic delays and add human-friendly time features for modeling:

```python
df = df[(df['dep_delay'] >= -60) & (df['dep_delay'] <= 1440)]
df['day_of_week'] = df['scheduled_dep'].dt.day_name()
```

**Narrative:** This removes clear data-entry errors and creates features like `day_of_week` that are highly predictive of delay patterns.

---

### 3) Feature engineering — route history
Capture recent route performance via rolling averages (e.g., last 30 flights on that origin→destination):

```python
df = df.sort_values(['origin','destination','scheduled_dep'])
df['route_avg_delay_30'] = df.groupby(['origin','destination'])['dep_delay'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(30, min_periods=1).mean())
```

**Narrative:** Route-level rolling averages are strong short-term predictors: delays often cascade along routes with recent problems.

---

### 4) Modeling — comparing classifiers
We trained both Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Random Forest was chosen as the production model.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)

lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Narrative:** Logistic Regression is an interpretable baseline. Random Forest captures non-linear interactions between schedule, route, and aircraft features.

---

### 5) Evaluation — classification report & ROC-AUC
We used precision/recall/f1 and ROC-AUC to compare models:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("ROC-AUC (RF):", roc_auc_score(y_test, rf.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]))
```

**Narrative:** Use ROC-AUC together with class-level metrics to balance operational trade-offs: false positives (unnecessary alerts) vs false negatives (missed delays).

---

### 6) Exporting predictions for Tableau
After generating predictions, export the enriched dataset for Tableau:

```python
df[['flight_id','scheduled_dep','origin','destination','predicted_dep_delay']].to_csv('data/flight_delay_with_predictions.csv', index=False)
```

**Narrative:** The export acts as a single source-of-truth for interactive dashboards and operational reporting.

## Model results (summary)

- **Models tested:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Best model:** Random Forest (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.7895)

**Logistic Regression — classification snapshot**
```
precision    recall  f1-score   support
0       0.75      0.67      0.71     14376
1       0.66      0.74      0.70     12583
accuracy                           0.70     26959
ROC-AUC (LR): 0.7822
```

**Random Forest — classification snapshot**
```
precision    recall  f1-score   support
0       0.73      0.72      0.72     14376
1       0.68      0.70      0.69     12583
accuracy                           0.71     26959
ROC-AUC (RF): 0.7895
```

**Interpretation:** Random Forest offered a modest but meaningful improvement in ROC-AUC and balanced precision/recall across classes, so it was saved as `tunisair_best_model.joblib`.

## Operational recommendations

- Monitor chronic-delay origin→destination pairs and allocate reserve crew on those routes.  
- Use the Streamlit app to run ad-hoc predictions for scheduled flights and inform passengers proactively.  
- Enrich the data with weather and ATC event features to further improve accuracy.
